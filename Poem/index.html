        <h1>Jabberwocky</h1>

          by <h2>Lewis Carroll</h2>

    <div class="paragraph">
    <p>
    'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br>

         Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:<br>

    <p>All mimsy were the borogoves,<br></p>

        And the mome raths outgrabe.<br>

     </p>

    <p><em>"Beware the Jabberwock, my son<strong>!</strong> <br>

            The jaws that bite, the claws that catch<strong>!</strong><br>

      <p>Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun<br></p>

            The frumious Bandersnatch!"</em><br>

    </p>

<p>He took his vorpal sword in hand;<br>

      Long time the manxome foe he soughtâ€” <br>

 <p>So rested he by the Tumtum tree<br></p>

      And stood awhile in thought.<br>
